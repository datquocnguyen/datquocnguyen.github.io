abstract = {A price information retrieval (IR) system allows users to search and view differences among prices of specific products. Building product-price driven IR system is a challenging and active research area. Approaches entirely depending products information provided by shops via interface environment encounter limitations of database. While automatic systems specifically require product names and commercial websites for their input. For both paradigms, approaches of building product-price IR system for Vietnamese are still very limited. In this paper, we introduce an automatic Vietnamese IR system for product-price by identifying and storing  Xpath patterns to extract prices of products from commercial websites. Experiments of our system show promising results.},
