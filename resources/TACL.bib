topics in document collections, while latent feature vector representations
of words have been used to obtain high performance in many NLP tasks. In
this paper, we extend two different Dirichlet multinomial topic models by
incorporating latent feature vector representations of words trained on very
large corpora to improve the word-topic mapping learnt on a smaller corpus.
Experimental results show that by using information from the external
corpora, our new models produce significant improvements on topic coherence,
document clustering and document classification tasks, especially on
datasets with few or short documents.},
