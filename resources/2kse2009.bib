 abstract = {Question answering systems aim to produce exact answers to users' questions instead of a list of related documents as used by current search engines. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based Vietnamese question answering system that allows users to express their questions in natural language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to enable users to query an ontological knowledge base using Vietnamese natural language. Experiments of our system on an organizational ontology show promising results.},
