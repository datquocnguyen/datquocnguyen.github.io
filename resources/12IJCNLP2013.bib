  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a study applying reject option to build a two-stage sentiment polarity classification system. We construct a Naive Bayes classifier at the first stage and a Support Vector Machine at the second stage, in which documents rejected at the first stage are forwarded to be classified at the second stage. The obtained accuracies are comparable to other state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, experiments show that our classifier requires less training data while still maintaining reasonable classification accuracy.},
