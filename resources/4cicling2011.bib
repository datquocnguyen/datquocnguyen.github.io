 abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to learn a rule based system for the task of part of speech tagging. Our approach is based on an incremental knowledge acquisition methodology where rules are stored in an exception-structure and new rules are only added to correct errors of existing rules; thus allowing systematic control of interaction between rules. Experimental results of our approach on English show that we achieve in the best accuracy published to date: 97.095% on the Penn Treebank corpus. We also obtain the best performance for Vietnamese VietTreeBank corpus.},
