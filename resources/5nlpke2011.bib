abstract = { Ontologies have served as a knowledge representation about the whole world or some part of it.  Building ontologies is a challenging and active research area. 
 Manually constructed Ontologies often have higher quality than the ones created by automatic or semi-automatic approaches but they tend to be more applicable to small domains. Automatic approaches are considered more suitable for building large scale Ontologies where time and efforts of human experts become a bottleneck. For both paradigms, approaches to building Ontologies from Vietnamese texts are still very limited. In this paper, we propose a system that automatically builds Ontology from Vietnamese texts using cascades of annotation-based grammars. Obtained experimental results on a university organizational structure domain are very promising. },
